#### FeedForward Artifical Neural Network (ANN)
     * CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
     * RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)

#### Basic Pattern
     * Linear Regression = Dense
     * Binary Logistic Regression = Dense -> Sigmoid
     * Multiclass Logistic Regression = Dense -> Softmax
     * ANN Regression = Dense -> Dense
     * ANN Binary Classification = Dense -> Dense -> Sigmoid
     * ANN Multiclass Classification = Dense -> Dense -> Softmax
